the trivial implementation of the Quicksort algorithm has a poor performance for repeated elements.
Quicksort is an efficient sorting algorithm based on the divide and conquer paradigm. Functionally speaking, it operates in-place
on the input array and rearranges the elements with simple comparison and swap operations.
